League-stats is a Symfony project, I built it in order to work on all the parts of the Riot Dev API which is probably the biggest API of current massive multi-player online games for now.

git clone https://github.com/Mordreak/LeagueStats.git<br>
composer install
composer update
php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force

### Prerequisites
